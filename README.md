# Matysiak_et_al_2023_EJP

This repository contains codes used to create the analysis for the paper:
Matysiak, A., Bellani, D., & Bogusz, H. (2023). Industrial Robots and Regional Fertility in European Countries. *European Journal of Population* 39(11). https://doi.org/10.1332/25151088Y2024D000000024

It contains the following folders: 
codes;\
final_data;\
generated_data;\
original_data;\
plots;\
tables.

The folder 'codes' contains eight Stata/R files. They should be run from 1 to 8 to generate all plots (folder 'plots') and tables (folder 'tables') displayed in the paper. The tables were manually summarized in the file '0_SUMMARY.xlsx' (folder 'tables'), which contains the final tables displayed in the publication.

The folder 'original_data' contains original data files used for the analysis. As all but one come from Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database), we publish them in the repository. 
The file 'ifr.csv', which contains robot stocks obtained from International Federation of Robotics, is not in the repository. The access to that data is restricted. The data can be purchased at https://ifr.org/ 
The folder 'generated_data' contains intermediate data files, while the folder 'final_data' contains two generated data files used for the analysis.
